Overview
========

Object Oriented Resonator Advanced Graphing and ANalysis (OORAGAN) is a library developped by me and other members of the Josephson Photonics and QIQSS research groups of the Université de Sherbrooke to fully process data from resonator measurements.

.. note:: 
   
   This library has been made to work with file formats **specific to the measurement setups used at the Université de Sherbrooke**. **Also**, the GitHub repository is a mirror of the development repository and no changes will be accepted on GitHub.

   Thanks to François Cyrenne-Bergeron for the name idea.

OORAGAN can be installed using pip with the following command : ::
