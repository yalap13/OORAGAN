# OORAGAN

Object Oriented Resonator Advanced Graphing and ANalysis (OORAGAN) is a library developped by me and other members of the Josephson Photonics and QIQSS research groups of the Université de Sherbrooke to fully process data from resonator measurements.

## Note

This library has been made to work with file formats **specific to the measurement setups used at the Université de Sherbrooke**. **Also**, the GitHub repository is a mirror of the development repository and no changes will be accepted on GitHub.

Thanks to François Cyrenne-Bergeron for the name idea.
